# CodeLibrary
A set of some example implementations for coding techniques I use regularly. These examples
are useful as I provide training and instruction to remote and junior developers in my teams.

## Delegates
Examples of all the different ways to implement delegates. These delegates are typically used
in Linq expressions which are provided as well.

## Linq
A few different techniques for writting a linq expression. Both inline SQL and Functional forms
layed out side by side.

Wrote a couple of examples for implmenting a strategy pattern for easy instruction for
junior developers.
